    <p>I'm embarking on a new & exciting journey. Starting August 18, I began the <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com"> DigitalCrafts <a/> 
    Flex Bootcamp in Atlanta. I am excited, nervous, scared, and motivated. I'm doing the bootcamp with the long-term goal of becoming a product manager. 
    I plan on using this blog to document my experience, what I learn, and have a place for other people to ask questions if they are thinking of doing something
    similar. So, cheers to new journeys, experiences, and learning!</p>

    <p>Here are my goals: 
        <ul>
            <li>Be at the top of my bootcamp cohort</li>
            <li>Update this blog weekly so I can showcase it in my portfolio</li>
            <li>Secure a job as a junior software engineer post-bootcamp within 3 months of graduating</li>
            <li>In the first year, pay my parents back for the money I borrowed (thanks, Dad & Kaye!)</li>
            <li>After the first year on the job, work on an additional freelance project to continue to learn</li>
            <li>After two years, get a remote job and move to Portugal!</li>
            <li>Complete a product management course</li>
            <li><strong>Have fun, make friends, and be a light to others</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
