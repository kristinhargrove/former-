    <p>My name is Kristin Hargrove. I'm 30 years old and live in Atlanta, GA. I grew up in Columbus, Ohio and moved to Atlanta after I graduated from Berry College
      in 2013. My mom still lives in Ohio and my dad lives in Portland, OR. Because my parents live so far apart, I get to travel fairly often just to visit family. 
      I enjoy travelling and also enjoy learning new things, staying active by playing sports (right now I love <a href = "https://spikeball.com/" target ="_ blank">Spikeball</a>), 
      eating and cooking, knitting, and reading. </p>
